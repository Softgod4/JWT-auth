# JWT-auth

JWT auth is my full stack project with registration, authorization and account deletion (as well as other goodies)
in the future it is planned to add a front-end part to the project with forms based on ReactJS, 
but now I am working on the main part of the project; namely over the Backend.
The project also includes working with a PostgreSQL database
